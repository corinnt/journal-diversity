# Diversity in Academic Publications

Generate visualizations of trends in gender and region of origin of scholars published in a given academic journal, as well as aggregate data for further analysis.

Note: Tool can be used to analyze any journal in the OpenAlex database; Gesta, a leading peer-reviewed academic journal in the area of medieval art, is set as the default. 

*example: generate maps of publications in Gesta between 2010 and 2020*
    
    python main.py --verbose -m --start_year 2010 --end_year 2020
