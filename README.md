# Diversity in Academic Publications

Generate visualizations of trends in gender and region of origin of scholars published in a given academic journal, as well as aggregate data for further analysis.

Note: Tool can be used to analyze any journal in the OpenAlex database; Gesta, a leading peer-reviewed academic journal in the area of medieval art, is set as the default. 

*example: generate maps of institutional affiliations of authors (Gesta, 2010-2020)*
    
    python main.py -m --start_year 2010 --end_year 2020 --verbose

*example: generate plots of gender of authors over time (USENIX, random sample of 500 papers)*

    python main.py -n usenix -s 500 -g --verbose

## Use Instructions


### 0. For first time set-up:
Set up your `config` file with an email to use as the reply-to for API calls, as well as filepaths to route data to. In order to use the gender analysis features, you will need to make an account with [Namsor](https://namsor.app/) to get an API key.

Build the conda environment to access the necessary packages:
<!--- Make code --->
     conda env create -f journal-diversity.yml

### 1. Activate the environment:
<!--- Make code --->
    conda activate journal-diversity

### 2. Run the program:

#### use in terminal:
<!--- Make code --->
    main.py config_path [-h] [-n JOURNAL_NAME] [-v] [-a] [-g] [-m] [-r] [--start_year START_YEAR] [--end_year END_YEAR] 
#### positional arguments: 
  `config_path`             the path to your config file

#### options:

  `-h`, `--help`            show this help message and exit
  
  `-n NAME`, `--journal_name NAME` 
                            name of journal or source to search for      

  `-s NUM`, `--sample NUM`  include sample size (max of 10,000) to analyze subset 

  `-v`, `--verbose`         include to print progress messages

  `-m`, `--write_maps`      include to plot locations of affiliated institutions

  `-g`, `--predict_genders` include to predict + plot genders of authors with Namsor API

  `r`, `--restore`          include to display cached data as specified by config file

  `--start_year START_YEAR` 
                            filter publications by this earliest year (inclusive)

  `--end_year END_YEAR`     filter publications by this latest year (inclusive)

### Note on gender prediction
This tool uses Namsor, which classifies personal names into binary male/female categories. This serves as an estimate, as gender is not binary and the software is not 100% accurate.
